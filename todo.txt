[√] Implement /signout which ends session
[√] dispay links that user created
[√] when creating links, link it to the user who created it.


MAYBE:
Add a checkUser helper to all server routes that require login, redirect the user to a login page as needed. Require users to log in to see shortened links and create new ones. Do NOT require the user to login when using a previously shortened link.

Using HTML5 pushstate, keep the URL in the address bar in sync with what page the user is viewing.

Find an image used on the site of the original url and use that instead of the generic icon (hint: use a regular expression or a parser to analyze the HTML document). How will you store this new information?
